# ScooterX

Hello, buddies. I'm going to tell you about my program, ScooterX, today. In my app, I used the Firebase Database. Firebase Authentication is used to bring back the login and sign-in areas. In my program, I used a map from Google Maps. I used data from the firebase, including each scooter's unique features, location, and price. In order to compute the price, I used a time counter that was adjusted based on the cost of each scooter. After signing up for the application, you may always verify your registration information without signing up again. Enjoy your day.
